## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

To make sure the desktop image is fixed to the left of the page at tablets and desktop screen sizes i made use of named grid lines for entire page and subgrid for the `body` children.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
body {
  display: grid;

  grid-template-columns:
    [page-start]
    minmax(var(--gutter), 1fr)
    [content-start]
    minmax(0, calc((min(100% - var(--gutter) * 2, 90rem)) / 2))
    [content-half]
    minmax(0, calc((min(100% - var(--gutter) * 2, 90rem)) / 2))
    [content-end]
    minmax(var(--gutter), 1fr)
    [page-end];
}

.main {
  & > * {
    grid-column: content;
  }
}

footer {
  & > * {
    grid-column: content;
  }
}
```

Also with the help of `subgrid` the `tools-grid` contents i.e `tools-item` is properly aligned from the image down to the heading and text.

checkout the code below

```css
.tools-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;
}

.tool-item {
  grid-row: span 3; /* tells the subgrid how many rows to take*/
  text-align: center;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: subgrid;
}
```

### Continued development

I would love to be able to build more stuffs with grid and flexbox, I want to assimilate the knowledge I learnt about them through projects I do.
